The Impact of Dropout on CNN Generalization: An In-depth Study Inspired by Srivastava et al.

This research project investigates the effectiveness of the Dropout technique in mitigating overfitting in deep neural networks, with a specific focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN. Originally introduced by Srivastava et al. in 2014, Dropout operates by randomly deactivating neurons during the training process, thereby encouraging the development of more robust features. This study not only replicates Srivastava et al.â€™s original findings but also expands the analysis to various CNN architectures and datasets, aiming to comprehend the extent to which Dropout contributes to enhancing the generalization capabilities of models.
